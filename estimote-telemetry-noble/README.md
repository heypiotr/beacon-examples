# Estimote Telemetry (runnable) specification

Simply read the (well-documented!) `scan.js` file to learn how the Estimote Telemetry packets are constructed and how to parse them.

But, the best part is, you can also run it!

You'll need:

- Node.js (e.g., from here: https://nodejs.org/en/, or on macOS, you could use [homebrew][h] and `brew install node`)
- meet the [_noble_ prerequisites][n] (_noble_ is a Node.js library that does BLE scanning)
- clone this repo and run `npm install` in this directoryâ€”this will install _noble_
- run `node scan.js`

[n]: https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble#prerequisites

Naturally, you'll also need some Estimote Beacons broadcasting the Telemetry packet (-:
